# AVpres-scripts

A repo for AVpres-related odds & ends.

Requirements:
* Python `3.6`

## `compare_md5s.py`

At BAVC, they're [converting ffv1/MKV files to v210/MOV](https://bavc.org/blog/converting-ffv1mkv-v210mov).  
For each file, they create checksums for the video and audio streams before and after transcode, and then compare the two in order to check the content integrity.

This script addresses that use case.

To run:
```bash
python3 compare_md5s.py
# Or:
python3 compare_md5s.py '/path/to/md5_directory'
```

Note that the path supplied is relative to the directory from which you call the script.
